                This is a web page I created to improve my web design languages/skills and to learn git. This is not a resume and should not be treated as one. Contact me in the tab above if you are interested in my actual resume. I hope you enjoy this as much as I enjoyed creating it.

                I am a junior studying math and computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

                <p> 
                I really enjoy solving math problems on my spare time. It started when my dad forced me to solve problems in order to play games. My interest grew and I got better when I joined my high school (Whitney Young) math team and started competing.

                <h3> Computer Science </h3>
                <p>
                No surprise that I like computer science as well.

                <h2> Goals and Plans </h2>
                <p> 
                I am interested in working at a leading technology company as a software or algorithms developer/engineeror or at a leader financial trading company as a trader. I love learning and solving problems and those companies are the ones that I enjoy working for and can benefit the most. There are a lot of smart people that I can refer to to expand my knowledge and give back to the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                Outside of my career goals, I want to improve my English and writing skills. I find these to be as important as technical skills because they can be transfered into any field. After that, I would love to learn Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese) and maybe French if I master Chinese. The reason is I want to go back to China (yes, I was born in China) and explore the country in the near future. In fact, I want to visit many other places as well. These include most of Europe, eastern Asia, and some parts of the Middle East. There are so many beautiful places there and I fear they will disappear soon because of conflicts, environment, etc. I want to see them with my own eyes before this happens.
