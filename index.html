                    This is a web page I created to improve my web design languages/skills and to learn git. This is not a resume and should not be treated as one. Contact me in the tab above if you are interested in my actual resume. I hope you enjoy this as much as I enjoyed creating it.

                <h2> General </h2>
                <p> 
                I am a junior studying math and computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

                <h2> Interests </h2>
                <h3> Math </h3>
                <p> 
                I really enjoy solving math problems on my spare time. It started when my dad forced me to solve problems in order to play games. My interest grew and I got better when I joined my high school (Whitney Young) math team and started competing.
                </p>
                <h3> Computer Science </h3>
                <p>
                No surprise that I like computer science as well.
                <p>
                <h3> Computers </h3>
                <p>
                This shouldn't be a huge surprise either. My fascination started when my high school friends were talking about their very powerful computers that they built. I felt left out because my computer was terrible and it was a prebuilt. 
                </p>
                <h3> Movies </h3>
                <p>
                Watching movies is my favorite relaxing pastime. My interest started a few years ago, when I saw the beauty of them. I made a list of movies that I have to see by choosing top rated movies from RottenTomatoes and IMDB. I am more than halfway done (222 out of 361) except my to-watch list is constantly growing. 
                </p>
                <h3> Music </h3>
                <p>
                </p>
                <h3> Nature </h3>
                <p>
                I find photos of nature to be very relaxing. I feel like I can forget about my current problems and find peace everytime I look at them.
                </p>

            <span class="anchor" id="goals"></span>
            <div id="goals_div">
                <h2> Goals and Plans </h2>
                <p> 
                I am interested in working at a leading technology company as a software or algorithms developer/engineer or at a leading financial trading company as a trader. I love learning and solving problems and those companies are the ones that I enjoy working for and can benefit the most. There are a lot of smart people that I can refer to to expand my knowledge and give back to the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                Outside of my career goals, I want to improve my English and writing skills. I find these to be as important as technical skills because they can be transfered into any field. After that, I would love to learn Chinese (both Mandarin and Cantonese) and maybe French if I master Chinese. The reason is I want to go back to China (yes, I was born in China) and explore the country in the near future. In fact, I want to visit many other places as well. These include most of Europe, eastern Asia, and some parts of the Middle East. There are so many beautiful places there and I fear they will disappear soon because of conflicts, environment, etc. I want to see them with my own eyes before this happens.
